# SongGenerator

## Node.js app in response to the Codecademy Mixed Messages Project

Some of the hardest things budding singer-songwriters can do are:-

1. Come up with a harmonically sound chord progression
2. Find a starting point for lyric writing
3. Come up with a band name

This app does all this for you. It was written entirely in javascript and can be run in node.js.

To get your chord progression, lyric starting point and band name just invoke the function randomSongGen() in node. The app will generate a response telling you which chords to use along with lyrics and a band name.

Grab a guitar and try it out.
